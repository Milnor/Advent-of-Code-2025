## Challenges

* On Day 3 I'm really feeling the technical debt of having to wait on Day 2 to
finish before I can see the results of my Day 3. I ought to add argument
parsing to select just the current day.

* On Day 4, debugging was a nuisance because I didn't add an `argparse` flag to
disable the full data sets and just run the samples.
