# Design

## Initial Brainstorm

* dataclass to hold data for each daily challenge
  * paths to data for Part 1, Part 2, smaller sample problems

* Or maybe it should be a Factory pattern with registry?

* add logging because I'm rusty at that skill

* add color and emojis - let's pretty print the heck out of the output

* Use ChatGPT for the cover art to save time

* The same Google Python Style Guide, `mypy`, and `pylint` stuff we use at work.

* Anything to reinforce the design patterns we teach in class would be great...
